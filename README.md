# DiDi_Gamejam18
A machine Learning Game

The SemesterGameJam at TUM is an event which takes place twice a year, where in the span of a weekend (or more exactly, 42 hours) 
a game idea is developed and implemented based on a single word. In my 5th semester I attended the GameJam again, where we developed 
the D.I/D.I. â€“ A Machine, learning in a group of 5 very talented people.\

D.I./D.I. is a small robot, who wakes up without any memories and skill outside of a research lab. 
After re-discovering his memories bit by bit, he has to relearn his skills to oppose his creator. 
Ethan, the creator of D.I./D.I. had built him as a weapon, which goes against the three rules of Robotics. 
Thus, D.I./D.I. has to find a way to set himself free, to life a peaceful life.

## Features
### Demo Level
A demo level to play through the short story, maneuvering the little robot, while figuring out which actions it can invoke.
